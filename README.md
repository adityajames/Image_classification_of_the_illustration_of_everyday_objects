# Image classification of the illustration of everyday objects
This repository is for the final project for the Applied Machine Learning course. 
Our study looks to carry out image classification on less commonly used data such as clipart, painting and quickdraw images to name a few. We found a collection of images which has been broadly categorized based on the type of image, namely painting, clipart, quickdraw, infograph,  real photograph, sketch. In each of these categories we have 345 image classes (e.g. airplane, clock, ball, bird, etc.). We use this dataset to answer the research questions that are elaborated below. Our project will aim to carry out the following objectives.
1) We aim to select three broad classes among ourselves and then carry out image classification across 345 classes subject to enough samples being available. 
2) We also would like to understand if models differentiate between color and black and white images, for this we plan to implement a clustering algorithm. 
3) Given that our datasets would be vastly different it would also be interesting to carry out a comparison study to see which technique was able to solve the problems better.
